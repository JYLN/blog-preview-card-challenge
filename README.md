## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS][tailwinddocs]
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/docs) - for simple static site building

### What I learned

As I continue using TailwindCSS, I continue to learn new things regarding the framework. For example, as I was refactoring my code during this project, I found out that you can simply attach a line height modifier to the font size utility class. Before I was doing this:

```html
<div class="text-sm leading-normal sm:text-lg sm:leading-normal"></div>
```

However with the modifier, I can cut out an unnecessary utility class like this:

```html
<div class="text-sm/normal sm:text-lg/normal"></div>
```

### Continued development

During this project, I initially used the `ring` utility class within Tailwind to produce the border around the card component. I did this because I was overtly focused on the "inside" border setting within the Figma design file for this project. It wasn't until refactoring my code, that I rememebered that Tailwind sets the `box-sizing` for every element as `border-box`, and borders are inherently inside the element with this box model setting.

All that to say, while coding designs, I would to focus more on remembering the fundamentals of the CSS language as I am piecing things together.
